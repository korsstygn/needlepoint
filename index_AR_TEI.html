        border between the two <span class="tei-placeName">
            <span class="country">Germanies</span>
        </span>.
        The extraordinary announcement represents the single most dramatic
        transformation of the political map of post-war <span class="tei-placeName">
            <span class="bloc">Europe</span>
        </span>. It follows a <span class="date">tumultuous week</span> during which the
        Communist authorities have vainly sought to stem a tide of popular opposition.
        Within hours, <span class="nationality">East Germans</span> on foot and in cars began
        arriving in <span class="tei-placeName">
            <span class="country">West Germany</span>

            <span class="settlement">West Berlin</span>
        </span>
        at <span class="time">9.15 pm (8.15 GMT)</span> with identity cards stamped
        with the new-style visas. The decision was announced by <span class="tei-persName">
            <span class="roleName">Mr</span>
            <span class="forename">Guenter</span>

        He said it would come into effect immediately, and would last until new travel
        regulations were passed into law. Soon afterwards, the official <span class="">
            <span class="orgTitle">ADN</span>
        </span>
        news agency said tens of thousands of people, many probably unaware of the new
        travel rules, took to the streets in several cities demanding free elections and
        liberalised travel. When <span class="nationality">East German</span> television
        carried the announcement, the station's switchboard was jammed almost instantly
        as thousands of callers tried to elicit more information. It was also announced <span class="date">yesterday</span> that <span class="tei-placeName">
            <span class="country">East Germany</span>
        </span>'s
        parliament will meet on <span class="date">Monday</span> to elect a new

        within <span class="tei-placeName">

        </span>
        can also obtain immediate permission. Because of the exceptional nature of the
        decision, passports will not be needed.

    The two days of hectic change in <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="settlement">East Berlin</span>
    </span>
    received the public blessing <span class="date">yesterday</span> of the <span class="orgName">Soviet foreign ministry</span> spokesman, <span class="tei-persName">
        <span class="roleName">Mr</span>
        <span class="forename">Gennady</span>
        <span class="surname">Gerasimov</span>
    </span>, who said: <span class="quote">“These changes are for the better, that is for sure.”</span> He hinted that the <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="bloc">Soviet Union</span>
    </span> would be prepared
    to accept a non-Communist government in <span class="tei-placeName">

    .<blockquote>"It's <span class="cb" />

        </span>
        .”
    </blockquote> The numbers fleeing <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="country">East Germany</span>
    </span>
    this year have now topped 200,000. Since <span class="date">last Friday</span>
    alone, more than 50,000 have left. <span class="date">Yesterday's</span>
    move has unpredictable consequences, but was clearly taken in the hope that the
    exodus could be slowed by giving people the opportunity of travelling or leaving
    whenever they wished. In a further concession to popular pressure, the <span class="orgName">Communist Party</span> called a special party
    conference which could result in leadership purges. Both announcements came
    after a turbulent session of the <span class="orgName">party</span>
    central committee at which members demanded “punishment” of those responsible
    for the political and economic crisis, and urged that no time must be lost in
    moving ahead on the path of renewal. The decision comes against a background of
    a crippling labour shortage, caused by the exodus. Soldiers and members of the
    secret police, the <span class="orgName">Stasi</span>, have been called in to help at
    hospitals, the public services, and public transport. Meanwhile, <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="country">East Germany</span>
    </span>'s
    biggest independent opposition group said it had been granted initial
    recognition as a political movement by the <span class="orgName">Interior Ministry</span>.<span class="orgName">New Forum</span> has
    been given three months to present a platform, and will then be able to contest
    elections as a “movement” rather than a political party. <span class="tei-persName">
        <span class="roleName">Mr</span>
        <span class="forename">Michael</span>
        <span class="surname">Goebel</span>
    </span>, a member, said <span class="orgName">New Forum</span> now had 200,000 supporters. The
    special <span class="orgName">party</span> conference will be held
    from <span class="date">December 15 to 17</span>. Its
    representatives have the power to elect and sack members of the present central
    committee. <span class="quote">“The party conference could well demonstrate who are the reformers and who are the hardliners in the central committee,”</span> one
    observer said. <span class="tei-persName">
        <span class="roleName">Mr</span>
        <span class="surname">Schabowski</span>
    </span> told reporters
    that <span class="date">yesterday</span>'s session had been <span class="quote">“lively”</span>.
    It concentrated on determining the reasons for the crisis and on finding answers
    to <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="country">East Germany</span>
    </span>'s
    variety of “perestroika”. Direct criticism had been levelled at the hardline
    leadership of <span class="tei-persName">

        <span class="forename">Erich</span>

    </span>
    of the reform process in the <span class="tei-placeName">

    </span>
    and a new politburo member, spoke of <span class="quote">“bitterness”</span> within the

    now at stake, <span class="tei-persName">
        <span class="roleName">Mr</span>
        <span class="surname">Modrow</span>
    </span> told the central

    pressure on the leadership. <blockquote>“Despite the seriousness of the situation,

        <span class="bloc">West</span>
    </span> was passed around the chamber. MPs

    </span> is the main
    boulevard in the centre of <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="settlement">West Berlin</span>
    </span>
    .
    <span class="quote">"I'm just going over to have a look,"</span> one excited man said.
    Another added: <span class="quote">"My wife is at home crying her eyes out because she has to look after the kids and can't come."</span> Trams rumbling towards the end
    station near the crossing point were packed with cheering <span class="nationality">East Berliners</span>. Those returning towards the centre of town were as
    empty as ghost trains. <blockquote>“I was a little girl when the <span class="objectName">Berlin Wall</span> was built. It was terrible,”</blockquote> recalled a woman in her
    early 40s at the <span class="objectName">Brandenburg Gate</span>.<span class="quote">“From now on, I will be able to visit my friends and relatives without the emotional strain and bureaucratic obstacles”,</span> she said. <span class="quote">“It had come to an end.”</span>
    A lorry driver at one of the crossing points said it was a <span class="quote">“day of joy”</span>
    for <span class="nationality">East Germans</span>. A 19-year-old woman, whose close
    friend had left for the <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="bloc">West</span>
    </span> only three weeks ago, was
    overjoyed: <span class="quote">"I can't believe it, it is wonderful, now I can go and visit her."</span> Meanwhile, at the <span class="objectName">Checkpoint Charlie</span>
    crossing point, <span class="nationality">East German</span> border police were
    stunned last night to learn that citizens could travel freely to the <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="bloc">West</span>
    </span>. In the 28 years since the <span class="objectName">Wall</span> was built, some 175 <span class="nationality">East Germans</span>
    have been shot dead trying to flee to the <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="bloc">West</span>
    </span>. The precise number of
    casualties is unknown, however, as many were wounded and dragged back, possibly
    to die later. <span class="quote">"People are going to read this and say 'there must be some mistake',"</span> said a young guard, shaken out of his normally severe bearing
    and talking animatedly. <span class="quote">"It's not good,"</span> another said an hour
    after the decision was announced. <span class="quote">"We will lose our jobs."</span>
    Traffic was light at the famous crossing, meant for foreign travellers through
    the communist-built <span class="objectName">Wall</span>, and only a few <span class="nationality">East Germans</span> were hanging around near the brightly-lit post. The
    commanding border police officer, a man about 30, slowly and deliberately read a
    dispatch about the open borders from the official news agency, <span class="">
        <span class="orgTitle">ADN</span>
    </span>
    .
    <span class="quote">“They [the people] will have to read this over very carefully, sometimes you have to read between the lines,”</span> he said, pointing to a
    line saying official permission to travel was still needed. Asked how many
    people might want to leave, the officer said he had heard talk in the force that
    two million of <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="country">East Germany</span>
    </span>'s
    16 million people might pack up and move <span class="tei-placeName">
        <span class="bloc">West</span>
    </span>. He said many could turn
    up as early as this morning, with or without the necessary papers, and agreed
    the early shift would be <span class="quote">"interesting"</span>.

        <span class="byline">Alan Travis and Patrick Donovan</span>
        THE Government yesterday
        signalled the end of its practical hopes for a big expansion of nuclear power by
        abandoning plans to build three new pressurised water reactors. Ministers intend
        to maintain a nuclear option, the cost of which will be reviewed after 1994, and
        will press ahead with the Sizewell B power station under construction. It
        appeared last night that the Prime Minister’s determination, born in the heat of
        the miners’ strike five years ago, to see a nuclear-fuelled Britain, had
        suffered a severe setback. It also dashed Mrs Thatcher’s hopes of securing the
        argument that nuclear power is more environmentally friendly than coal. The
        Central Electricity Generating Board was asked yesterday to reconsider its
        applications to build further PWR stations at Hinkley Point C, Wylfa B and
        Sizewell C. The Hinkley inquiry, which was due to reach its conclusion next
        week, is likely to be abandoned. The rapid scaling down of the government’s
        nuclear ambitions came as the Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeman, confirmed to
        the House of Commons that all Britain’s nuclear power stations are to be pulled
        from next year’s staggered £20 billion sale of the electricity industry. Later
        last night Mr Wakeham said the long-expected decision had been forced by the
        refusal of City banks and institutions to carry the financial risk of
        decommissioning radioactive power stations and disposal of nuclear waste. He
        said if he agreed to the flotation terms demanded by the City “this would not
        have been a privatisation”. Lord Marshall, chairman of National Power, the CEGB
        successor company formed to operate nuclear power in the private sector, has
        been asked by the Government to resign. In a letter to all National Power staff,
        Lord Marshall yesterday said he was “reviewing his position”. He is expected to
        announce his departure today. Conservative MPs claimed Lord Marshall for
        misleading the Government over the future costs of nuclear power. Mr Wakeham was
        privately said to have blamed his predecessor, Mr Cecil Parkinson, for the
        disasters surrounding electricity privatisation. He told the Commons yesterday
        the previous estimates did not bear any true relationship to the costs of
        nuclear power: “I am not blaming anybody particularly for that, but it was in
        fact only on October 11 that I finally managed to get the figures I needed to
        make this decision, having pressed very hard for them from the moment I arrived
        in office.” The Government is to retain the 10 ageing Magnox stations and seven
        AGRs in a new publicly-owned nuclear company, chaired by Mr John Collier,
        currently chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority. National Power’s chief
        executive, Mr John Baker, said the move had “considerable implications for the
        development of nuclear power in Britain”. “In taking these steps, the Government
        has decided that its overriding priority is the successful privatisation of the
        electricity industry,” he said. Mr Collier said there was public confusion over
        nuclear power. “We have to demonstrate that nuclear power is not only safe but
        economic. There is no doubt that the public has been confused by press reports
        about the financial risks of nuclear power.” The announcement means 80 per cent
        of the £2.7 billion assets of the South of Scotland Electricity Board will
        remain in public ownership. The new English nuclear company will have a
        “positive cash flow” but it was clear last night that its “profitability” would
        depend on the nuclear tax levied on the rest of the electricity industry.
        Labour’s energy spokesman, Mr Frank Dobson, last night described the
        announcement as a humiliating climbdown which had to be taken as the nuclear
        power stations had proved unsaleable. Reports, page 2; Leader Comment, page 22

        <span class="head">THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT</span> Global temperatures are rising. The effects are unpredictable
        and likely to be catastrophic. Among the causes are pollution from energy
        production, car exhausts and CFC gases. The answer? - Efficient energy use,
        cleaner methods of electricity production, and the development of renewable
        energy resources. Greenpeace is campaigning to reduce all pollutants which
        contribute to the greenhouse effect: for an end to wasteful forms of electricity
        production, for positive measures to save energy, for reductions in car
