00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,200
the end of the berin wall is a symbol of

3
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:15,558
the end of a divided Europe and the end

4
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:17,319
of C War nobody could believe this was

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,838
real it was a

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,239
miracle for the they were at the door

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,278
disbelief nobody could foresee how and

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,759
if and when it would happen I mean it

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,520
was brought down

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,438
by the Soviet Reform movement developing

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,399
which then spread to Eastern Europe and

19
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,639
then the strength of people in these

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,160
various countries particularly in East

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,039
Germany and beginning to demonstrate

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,078

class Banana Republic but he is happens

29
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:22,958
to be the head of the number one

30
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:23,719
socialist country and if he talks about

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,199
the

32
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:30,558
necessity of opening

33
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:34,639

36
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,318
there's Reason for

37
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,1000
Hope there was so much happening there

38
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,639

conference by one of the Democracy

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,880
movements you had to dash so you you

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
heard these things you saw them on an

43
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,037
East German television or ADN there was

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
no there were no mo mobile phones you

45
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,959
weren't told anything you have to find

46
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,077
out yourself what was happening by going

47
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,518
to the Press Center and you were

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:09,518
constantly on the road and you know

49
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:11,438
chasing one story after the other and so

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,959
it was in the 9th of November on the

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,439
evening of that day G chabowski gave his

52
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,680
press conference during which he was

53
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,679
handed this piece of paper saying that

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,519
East Germany would open its borders to

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,120
the west and he read it out almost as if

56
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:26,160
it was an accident of history and

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,719
afterthought that East Germany was

58
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,719
opening its borders

59
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,478
party leadership actually didn't intend

60
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,598
the wall to come down they made a

61
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,958
mistake they announced a decision which

62
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,478
was meant to be saying at you know in

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,359
the next few hours we're going to make

64
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:44,958
it possible for people to cross the

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,318
board without visas they said it's

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,318
happening now and people rushed

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,919
out at 11:30 p.m. one of the uh

68
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:59,199
commanding officers just decided to open

69
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,438
the gate uh because there were too many

70
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,679
people he could couldn't hold back

71
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:08,517
anymore people were streaming to the

72
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:11,479
wall in the Eastern side and coming on

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,400
the other side from the west and they

74
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,839
didn't immediately Rush one or two

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,760
tested what the folks Poli ey would do

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
and the Border guards whether they would

77
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,799
shoot because nobody believed this was

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,200
for

79
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
[Music]

80
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,479
real but eventually one or two went

81
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,399
across and then just screams and screams

82
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,759
followed and one trabant after the other

83
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,759
Road

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,958
it's wonderful we are we have seen it in

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,239
TV it it was

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,760
super then half my daughter's class

87
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,879
arrived at our door in the middle of the

88
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,119
night really excited shouting the wall

89
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,038
is open we walk through the wall I knew

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,158
them all they came up to our flat and I

91
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,039
got all the alcohol out of the fridge

92
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,638
and we celebrated our

93
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,718
reunion my neighbor came and rang the

94
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:01,719
the door and said Eliz aeth

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,079
often so grab your ID card and come the

96
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,157
wall is everybody goes everybody's

97
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,079
leaving we went to Checkpoint Charlie

98
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,358
because this is where what was open and

99
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,639
we didn't have the right money at that

100
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:19,119
time in the middle of the night and

101
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,919
there was everybody there so a huge

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,639
party without alcohol because nobody had

103
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:28,918
anything in the morning Big East German

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,959
mechanical diggers came and made a hole

105
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:34,398
in the wall near the Brandenburg gate

106
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:37,399
because there was a big rally with vly

107
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,238
brunt and hwood Cole a big historic

108
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,918
rally as big and historic and important

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,240
as Kennedy's visit to to Berlin so many

110
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:45,239
years

111
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,239
before a lot of uh people came with

112
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,197
little chisels and Hammers and pecked

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
away at the wall to take little bits

114
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,479
away because it it it was surely going

115
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,278
to be a very important uh

116
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,758
memorabilia to have in the future I was

117
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,758
totally under some sort of cultural

118
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,079
shock I couldn't stand all the choice

119
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,440
and all the uh sort of these colorful

120
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,037
things each time I came back from R

121
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,637
Berlin I was sort of I rested my eyes I

122
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,637
literally rested my eyes and my soul and

123
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,759
was happy to be back in the East my gray

124
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:27,959
East just because the all these colors

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,959
were way too much for us

126
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,799
the aims of the people were

127
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,239
demonstrating initially and I think the

128
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,759
expectation of most people who were

129
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,478
analyzing it and Reporting on it and

130
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:42,360
watching it was that this would reform

131
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,958
the system that the system would have to

132
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,360
reform they didn't think that the war

133
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,558
would come down and the Germany would be

134
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,440
reunited somehow it was thought that

135
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,439
that wasn't going to happen
