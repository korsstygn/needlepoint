                    <date when="1989-11-09">last night</date> took the momentous step of allowing all citizens direct passage to the <placeName>
                    <bloc>West</bloc>
                </placeName> in a step that renders obsolete the <objectName>Berlin Wall</objectName> and puts into question the border between the two <placeName>
                <country type="nation">Germanies</country>
            </placeName>.
            <lb />
					The extraordinary announcement represents the single most dramatic transformation of the political map of post-war <placeName>
            <bloc>Europe</bloc>
        </placeName>. It follows a <date from="1989-11-02" to="1989-11-09">tumultuous week</date> during which the Communist authorities have vainly sought to stem a tide of popular opposition.
        <lb />
					Within hours, <nationality>East Germans</nationality> on foot and in cars began arriving in <placeName>
        <country type="nation">West Germany</country>
    </placeName> and <placeName>
    <settlement type="city">West Berlin</settlement>
</placeName>.<nationality>West German</nationality> television said a couple crossed the <placeName type="street">Bornholmer Strasse</placeName> checkpoint in <placeName>
<settlement type="city">West Berlin</settlement>
</placeName> at <time when="09:15:00">9.15 pm (8.15 GMT)</time> with identity cards stamped with the new-style visas.
<lb />
					The decision was announced by <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Guenter</forename>
<surname>Schabowski</surname>
</persName>, a politburo member, after the second day of a central committee meeting in<placeName>
<settlement type="city">East Berlin</settlement>
</placeName>. He said it would come into effect immediately, and would last until new travel regulations were passed into law.
<lb />
					Soon afterwards, the official <orgName>
<orgTitle type="acronym" reg="Allgemeiner Deutscher Nachrichtendienst">ADN</orgTitle>
</orgName> news agency said tens of thousands of people, many probably unaware of the new travel rules, took to the streets in several cities demanding free elections and liberalised travel.
<lb />
					When <nationality>East German</nationality> television carried the announcement, the station's switchboard was jammed almost instantly as thousands of callers tried to elicit more information.
<lb />
					It was also announced <date when="1989-11-09">yesterday</date> that <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName>'s parliament will meet on <date when="1989-11-13">Monday</date> to elect a new Prime Minister, and charge him with forming a new government. The <orgName type="politicaParty">Communist Party</orgName> has nominated the reformist, <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Hans</forename>
<surname>Modrow</surname>
</persName>, for the top job in the government, after the former administration under the hardliner, <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Willi</forename>
<surname>Stoph</surname>
</persName>, resigned on <date when="1989-11-07">Tuesday</date>, the day before the politburo stepped down to make way for a new team.
<lb />
<nationality>East Germans</nationality> will be able to obtain exit visas without delay, allowing them to cross into the <placeName>
<bloc>West</bloc>
</placeName> through all border points within <placeName>
<settlement type="city">Berlin</settlement>
</placeName> and along the border with <placeName>
<country type="nation">West Germany</country>
</placeName>. Tourists who want to return to <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName> can also obtain immediate permission. Because of the exceptional nature of the decision, passports will not be needed. <quote>“We have decided today that all <nationality>East Germans</nationality> who want to leave permanently can do so without delay.”</quote>
<lb />
					The two days of hectic change in <placeName>
<settlement type="city">East Berlin</settlement>
</placeName> received the public blessing <date when="1989-11-09">yesterday</date> of the <orgName type="phrase">Soviet foreign ministry</orgName> spokesman, <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Gennady</forename>
<surname>Gerasimov</surname>
</persName>, who said: <quote>“These changes are for the better, that is for sure.”</quote>
<lb />
					He hinted that the <placeName>
<bloc>Soviet Union</bloc>
</placeName> would be prepared to accept a non-Communist government in <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName>.<quote>"It's

<lb />
					The numbers fleeing <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName> this year have now topped 200,000. Since <date when="1989-11-03">last Friday</date> alone, more than 50,000 have left. <date when="1989-11-09">Yesterday's</date> move has unpredictable consequences, but was clearly taken in the hope that the exodus could be slowed by giving people the opportunity of travelling or leaving whenever they wished.
<lb />
					In a further concession to popular pressure, the <orgName type="politicalParty">Communist Party</orgName> called a special party conference which could result in leadership purges.
<lb />
					Both announcements came after a turbulent session of the <orgName type="politicalParty">party</orgName> central committee at which members demanded “punishment” of those responsible for the political and economic crisis, and urged that no time must be lost in moving ahead on the path of renewal.
<lb />
					The decision comes against a background of a crippling labour shortage, caused by the exodus. Soldiers and members of the secret police, the <orgName>Stasi</orgName>, have been called in to help at hospitals, the public services, and public transport.
<lb />
					Meanwhile, <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName>'s biggest independent opposition group said it had been granted initial recognition as a political movement by the <orgName type="phrase">Interior Ministry</orgName>.<orgName type="politicalMovement">New Forum</orgName> has been given three months to present a platform, and will then be able to contest elections as a “movement” rather than a political party. <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Michael</forename>
<surname>Goebel</surname>
</persName>, a member, said <orgName type="politicalMovement">New Forum</orgName> now had 200,000 supporters.
<lb />
					The special <orgName type="politicalParty">party</orgName> conference will be held from <date from="1989-12-15" to="1989-12-17">December 15 to 17</date>. Its representatives have the power to elect and sack members of the present central committee. <quote> “The party conference could well demonstrate who are the reformers and who are the hardliners in the central committee,”</quote> one observer said.
<lb />
<persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<surname>Schabowski</surname>
</persName> told reporters that <date when="1989-11-09">yesterday</date>'s session had been <quote>“lively”</quote>. It concentrated on determining the reasons for the crisis and on finding answers to <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName>'s variety of “perestroika”.
<lb />
					Direct criticism had been levelled at the hardline leadership of <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb"> Mr</roleName>
<forename>Erich</forename>
<surname>Honecker</surname>
</persName> and others, who had failed to recognise the relevance for <placeName>
<country type="nation">East Germany</country>
</placeName> of the reform process in the <placeName>
<bloc>Soviet Union</bloc>
</placeName>.
<lb />
<persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr</roleName>
<forename>Hans</forename>
<surname>Modrow</surname>
</persName>, the reform-minded party chief of <placeName>
<settlement type="city">Dresden</settlement>
</placeName> and a new politburo member, spoke of <quote>“bitterness”</quote> within the party about the grave mistakes of the past.
<lb />
					The very existence of the party was now at stake, <persName>
<roleName type="honorific" full="abb"> Mr</roleName>
<surname>Modrow</surname>
</persName> told the central committee, and any further <quote>“dithering”</quote> would only increase pressure on the leadership. <quote>“Despite the seriousness of the situation, socialism still has a chance in the <placeName>

<head type="Secondary">Nuclear reactors scrapped</head>
<byline>Alan Travis and Patrick Donovan</byline>
<lb/>
<seg rend="initial">T</seg>HE Government yesterday signalled the end of its practical hopes for a big expansion of nuclear power by abandoning plans to build three new pressurised water reactors.
<lb/>
Ministers intend to maintain a nuclear option, the cost of which will be reviewed after 1994, and will press ahead with the Sizewell B power station under construction. It appeared last night that the Prime Minister’s determination, born in the heat of the miners’ strike five years ago, to see a nuclear-fuelled Britain, had suffered a severe setback. It also dashed Mrs Thatcher’s hopes of securing the argument that nuclear power is more environmentally friendly than coal.<lb/>
The Central Electricity Generating Board was asked yesterday to reconsider its applications to build further PWR stations at Hinkley Point C, Wylfa B and Sizewell C. The Hinkley inquiry, which was due to reach its conclusion next week, is likely to be abandoned.
<lb/>
The rapid scaling down of the government’s nuclear ambitions came as the Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeman, confirmed to the House of Commons that all Britain’s nuclear power stations are to be pulled from next year’s staggered £20 billion sale of the electricity industry.
<lb/>
Later last night Mr Wakeham said the long-expected decision had been forced by the refusal of City banks and institutions to carry the financial risk of decommissioning radioactive power stations and disposal of nuclear waste. He said if he agreed to the flotation terms demanded by the City “this would not have been a privatisation”.
<lb/>
Lord Marshall, chairman of National Power, the CEGB successor company formed to operate nuclear power in the private sector, has been asked by the Government to resign. In a letter to all National Power staff, Lord Marshall yesterday said he was “reviewing his position”. He is expected to announce his departure today.
<lb/>
Conservative MPs claimed Lord Marshall for misleading the Government over the future costs of nuclear power. Mr Wakeham was privately said to have blamed his predecessor, Mr Cecil Parkinson, for the disasters surrounding electricity privatisation. He told the Commons yesterday the previous estimates did not bear any true relationship to the costs of nuclear power: “I am not blaming anybody particularly for that, but it was in fact only on October 11 that I finally managed to get the figures I needed to make this decision, having pressed very hard for them from the moment I arrived in office.”
<lb/>
The Government is to retain the 10 ageing Magnox stations and seven AGRs in a new publicly-owned nuclear company, chaired by Mr John Collier, currently chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority.
<lb/>
National Power’s chief executive, Mr John Baker, said the move had “considerable implications for the development of nuclear power in Britain”. “In taking these steps, the Government has decided that its overriding priority is the successful privatisation of the electricity industry,” he said.
<lb/>
Mr Collier said there was public confusion over nuclear power. “We have to demonstrate that nuclear power is not only safe but economic. There is no doubt that the public has been confused by press reports about the financial risks of nuclear power.”
<lb/>
The announcement means 80 per cent of the £2.7 billion assets of the South of Scotland Electricity Board will remain in public ownership.
<lb/>
The new English nuclear company will have a “positive cash flow” but it was clear last night that its “profitability” would depend on the nuclear tax levied on the rest of the electricity industry.
<lb/>
Labour’s energy spokesman, Mr Frank Dobson, last night described the announcement as a humiliating climbdown which had to be taken as the nuclear power stations had proved unsaleable.

<head>THE GREENHOUSE<lb/>
EFFECT</head>
<lb/>
Global temperatures are rising. The effects are unpredictable and likely to be catastrophic. Among the causes are pollution from energy production, car exhausts and CFC gases.
<lb/>
The answer? - Efficient energy use, cleaner methods of electricity production, and the development of renewable energy resources.
<lb/>
Greenpeace is campaigning to reduce all pollutants which contribute to the greenhouse effect: for an end to wasteful forms of electricity production, for positive measures to save energy, for reductions in car emissions, and for an immediate end to all production of CFCs.
