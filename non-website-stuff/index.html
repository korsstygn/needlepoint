  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Exchanges jam in clamour of exit
    inquiries Anna Tomforde in East Berlin EAST Germany's ruling Communist
    Party last night took the momentous step of allowing all citizens direct
    passage to the West in a step that renders obsolete the Berlin Wall and
    puts into question the border between the two Germanies . The
    extraordinary announcement represents the single most dramatic
    transformation of the political map of post-war Europe . It follows a
    tumultuous week during which the Communist authorities have vainly sought
    to stem a tide of popular opposition. Within hours, East Germans on foot
    and in cars began arriving in West Germany and West Berlin .West German
    television said a couple crossed the Bornholmer Strasse checkpoint in West
    Berlin at 9.15 pm (8.15 GMT) with identity cards stamped with the
    new-style visas. The decision was announced by Mr Guenter Schabowski , a
    politburo member, after the second day of a central committee meeting in
    East Berlin . He said it would come into effect immediately, and would
    last until new travel regulations were passed into law. Soon afterwards,
    the official ADN news agency said tens of thousands of people, many
    probably unaware of the new travel rules, took to the streets in several
    cities demanding free elections and liberalised travel. When East German
    television carried the announcement, the station's switchboard was jammed
    almost instantly as thousands of callers tried to elicit more information.
    It was also announced yesterday that East Germany 's parliament will meet
    on Monday to elect a new Prime Minister, and charge him with forming a new
    government. The Communist Party has nominated the reformist, Mr Hans
    Modrow , for the top job in the government, after the former
    administration under the hardliner, Mr Willi Stoph , resigned on Tuesday,
    the day before the politburo stepped down to make way for a new team. East
    Germans will be able to obtain exit visas without delay, allowing them to
    cross into the West through all border points within Berlin and along the
    border with West Germany . Tourists who want to return to East Germany can
    also obtain immediate permission. Because of the exceptional nature of the
    decision, passports will not be needed. “We have decided today that all
    East Germans who want to leave permanently can do so without delay.” The
    two days of hectic change in East Berlin received the public blessing
    yesterday of the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, Mr Gennady Gerasimov ,
    who said: “These changes are for the better, that is for sure.” He hinted
    that the Soviet Union would be prepared to accept a non-Communist
    government in East Germany ."It's their ( East Germany 's) decision, just
    like in Poland ... Poland is a good member of the Warsaw Pact, and in
    Poland you have a coalition, you don't have Communist government in Poland
    .” The numbers fleeing East Germany this year have now topped 200,000.
    Since last Friday alone, more than 50,000 have left. Yesterday's move has
    unpredictable consequences, but was clearly taken in the hope that the
    exodus could be slowed by giving people the opportunity of travelling or
    leaving whenever they wished. In a further concession to popular pressure,
    the Communist Party called a special party conference which could result
    in leadership purges. Both announcements came after a turbulent session of
    the party central committee at which members demanded “punishment” of
    those responsible for the political and economic crisis, and urged that no
    time must be lost in moving ahead on the path of renewal. The decision
    comes against a background of a crippling labour shortage, caused by the
    exodus. Soldiers and members of the secret police, the Stasi, have been
    called in to help at hospitals, the public services, and public transport.
    Meanwhile, East Germany 's biggest independent opposition group said it
    had been granted initial recognition as a political movement by the
    Interior Ministry.New Forum has been given three months to present a
    platform, and will then be able to contest elections as a “movement”
    rather than a political party. Mr Michael Goebel , a member, said New
    Forum now had 200,000 supporters. The special party conference will be
    held from December 15 to 17. Its representatives have the power to elect
    and sack members of the present central committee. “The party conference
    could well demonstrate who are the reformers and who are the hardliners in
    the central committee,” one observer said. Mr Schabowski told reporters
    that yesterday's session had been “lively”. It concentrated on determining
    the reasons for the crisis and on finding answers to East Germany 's
    variety of “perestroika”. Direct criticism had been levelled at the
    hardline leadership of Mr Erich Honecker and others, who had failed to
    recognise the relevance for East Germany of the reform process in the
    Soviet Union . Mr Hans Modrow , the reform-minded party chief of Dresden
    and a new politburo member, spoke of “bitterness” within the party about
    the grave mistakes of the past. The very existence of the party was now at
    stake, Mr Modrow told the central committee, and any further “dithering”
    would only increase pressure on the leadership. “Despite the seriousness
    of the situation, socialism still has a chance in the GDR ,” he said. East

  for a day or two because the city could not cope.
  “Anyone who wants can come over,” he said. But “please, even with all the

  Nonetheless, in

    Tomforde and Agencies in East Berlin HUNDREDS of youths last night
    clambered up to dance atop the Berlin Wall near the most potent symbol of
    the divided Germanies , the Brandenburg Gate.West Germans, carrying
    hammers to chip away at the surface, rushed forward to greet them. East
    German border guards at times sprayed the crowd with water cannon but
    otherwise let the crowd revel on unchecked.
    "Open the gate! Open the gate!" the East Berliners shouted as the
    gathering grew with the news that the borders would be opened. All along
    the wall, West Berliners trampled over the white demarcation line dividing
    the city, in effect crossing into the East . Groups of people held aloft
    bottles of beer and champagne and climbed up scaffolding to get a better
    view of the bewildering scenes. At the Bornholmer Strasse crossing point,
    a line of cars more than half a mile long piled up, with drivers tooting
    their horns in joy. Border police just gave up and let everybody through
    without checking, and first aid teams were on hand to help some people who
    fainted with emotion. “We're off to the Kudamm ,” pedestrians shouted as
    they whooped and cheered their way towards the crossing point like
    football fans flocking into a stadium. Kurfuerstendamm is the main
    boulevard in the centre of West Berlin .
    "I'm just going over to have a look," one excited man said. Another added:
    "My wife is at home crying her eyes out because she has to look after the kids and can't come."
    Trams rumbling towards the end station near the crossing point were packed
    with cheering East Berliners. Those returning towards the centre of town
    were as empty as ghost trains. “I was a little girl when the Berlin Wall
    was built. It was terrible,” recalled a woman in her early 40s at the
    Brandenburg Gate.“From now on, I will be able to visit my friends and
    relatives without the emotional strain and bureaucratic obstacles”, she
    said. “It had come to an end.” A lorry driver at one of the crossing
    points said it was a “day of joy” for East Germans. A 19-year-old woman,
    whose close friend had left for the West only three weeks ago, was
    overjoyed:
    "I can't believe it, it is wonderful, now I can go and visit her."
    Meanwhile, at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point, East German border
    police were stunned last night to learn that citizens could travel freely
    to the West . In the 28 years since the Wall was built, some 175 East
    Germans have been shot dead trying to flee to the West . The precise
    number of casualties is unknown, however, as many were wounded and dragged
    back, possibly to die later.
    "People are going to read this and say 'there must be some mistake'," said
    a young guard, shaken out of his normally severe bearing and talking
    animatedly. "It's not good," another said an hour after the decision was
    announced. "We will lose our jobs." Traffic was light at the famous
    crossing, meant for foreign travellers through the communist-built Wall,
    and only a few East Germans were hanging around near the brightly-lit
    post. The commanding border police officer, a man about 30, slowly and
    deliberately read a dispatch about the open borders from the official news
    agency, ADN . “They [the people] will have to read this over very
    carefully, sometimes you have to read between the lines,” he said,
    pointing to a line saying official permission to travel was still needed.
    Asked how many people might want to leave, the officer said he had heard
    talk in the force that two million of East Germany 's 16 million people
    might pack up and move West . He said many could turn up as early as this
    morning, with or without the necessary papers, and agreed the early shift
    would be "interesting".</p>

  <p xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0">Nuclear reactors scrapped Alan Travis
    and Patrick Donovan THE Government yesterday signalled the end of its
    practical hopes for a big expansion of nuclear power by abandoning plans
    to build three new pressurised water reactors. Ministers intend to
    maintain a nuclear option, the cost of which will be reviewed after 1994,
    and will press ahead with the Sizewell B power station under construction.
    It appeared last night that the Prime Minister’s determination, born in
    the heat of the miners’ strike five years ago, to see a nuclear-fuelled
    Britain, had suffered a severe setback. It also dashed Mrs Thatcher’s
    hopes of securing the argument that nuclear power is more environmentally
    friendly than coal. The Central Electricity Generating Board was asked
    yesterday to reconsider its applications to build further PWR stations at
    Hinkley Point C, Wylfa B and Sizewell C. The Hinkley inquiry, which was
    due to reach its conclusion next week, is likely to be abandoned. The
    rapid scaling down of the government’s nuclear ambitions came as the
    Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeman, confirmed to the House of Commons that
    all Britain’s nuclear power stations are to be pulled from next year’s
    staggered £20 billion sale of the electricity industry. Later last night
    Mr Wakeham said the long-expected decision had been forced by the refusal
    of City banks and institutions to carry the financial risk of
    decommissioning radioactive power stations and disposal of nuclear waste.
    He said if he agreed to the flotation terms demanded by the City “this
    would not have been a privatisation”. Lord Marshall, chairman of National
    Power, the CEGB successor company formed to operate nuclear power in the
    private sector, has been asked by the Government to resign. In a letter to
    all National Power staff, Lord Marshall yesterday said he was “reviewing
    his position”. He is expected to announce his departure today.
    Conservative MPs claimed Lord Marshall for misleading the Government over
    the future costs of nuclear power. Mr Wakeham was privately said to have
    blamed his predecessor, Mr Cecil Parkinson, for the disasters surrounding
    electricity privatisation. He told the Commons yesterday the previous
    estimates did not bear any true relationship to the costs of nuclear
    power: “I am not blaming anybody particularly for that, but it was in fact
    only on October 11 that I finally managed to get the figures I needed to
    make this decision, having pressed very hard for them from the moment I
    arrived in office.” The Government is to retain the 10 ageing Magnox
    stations and seven AGRs in a new publicly-owned nuclear company, chaired
    by Mr John Collier, currently chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority.
    National Power’s chief executive, Mr John Baker, said the move had
    “considerable implications for the development of nuclear power in
    Britain”. “In taking these steps, the Government has decided that its
    overriding priority is the successful privatisation of the electricity
    industry,” he said. Mr Collier said there was public confusion over
    nuclear power. “We have to demonstrate that nuclear power is not only safe
    but economic. There is no doubt that the public has been confused by press
    reports about the financial risks of nuclear power.” The announcement
    means 80 per cent of the £2.7 billion assets of the South of Scotland
    Electricity Board will remain in public ownership. The new English nuclear
    company will have a “positive cash flow” but it was clear last night that
    its “profitability” would depend on the nuclear tax levied on the rest of
    the electricity industry. Labour’s energy spokesman, Mr Frank Dobson, last
    night described the announcement as a humiliating climbdown which had to
    be taken as the nuclear power stations had proved unsaleable. Reports,

      Global temperatures are rising. The effects are unpredictable and likely
      to be catastrophic. Among the causes are pollution from energy production,
      car exhausts and CFC gases. The answer? - Efficient energy use, cleaner
      methods of electricity production, and the development of renewable energy
      resources. Greenpeace is campaigning to reduce all pollutants which
      contribute to the greenhouse effect: for an end to wasteful forms of
      electricity production, for positive measures to save energy, for
      reductions in car emissions, and for an immediate end to all production of
      CFCs. THANK GOD SOMEONE’S MAKING WAVES ===================================
